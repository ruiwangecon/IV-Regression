# Simulation Code for IV Regression without Exclusion Restrictions

This repository contains R code for the empirical results of the paper 'IV Regressions without Exclusion Restrictions,' by Wayne Gao and Rui Wang.

The latest version of the working paper and the dataset are available in this repository. The dataset is from the National Longitudinal Surveys (https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm), and we only use a subset of the full dataset for the application.
